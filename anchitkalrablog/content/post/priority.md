How to Prioritize Like a Pro (Without Losing Your Sanity)
There’s always something urgent, something important, and something that looks important but is actually just a distraction in disguise. So, how do you decide what gets done first without losing your mind? Let’s break it down.

### 1. Business Value vs. Customer Impact
When prioritizing tasks, it’s important to align efforts with business objectives and customer needs.
 - Business Value: Does this task improve the product, drive revenue, or enhance competitive advantage?
 - Customer Impact: Does this solve a major pain point, improve user experience, or prevent churn?
Ideally, the highest-priority work should bring both business value and customer impact.
### 2. Urgent vs. Important
Understanding the difference between urgent and important tasks helps in making strategic decisions:
 - Important tasks drive long-term value and product improvements.
 - Urgent tasks require immediate attention to keep the project moving (e.g., production issues, critical bugs).
Rule of Thumb: Urgency should not always override importance. Address urgent issues when necessary but ensure that important, high-value work isn’t continuously delayed.
### 3. Bandwidth and Effort
Before diving into tasks, assess the required effort and available bandwidth. Ask:
 - Would completing low hanging fruit (quick wins) first help clear the backlog?
 - Is a particular task a bottleneck preventing further progress?
Balancing effort vs. impact ensures teams remain productive without getting overwhelmed.
### 4. Policies for Prioritization
Defining clear policies for prioritization reduces ambiguity. One effective approach is using Severity and Likelihood to assess the impact of bugs or changes:
 - Likelihood: How often does the problem occur?
 - Severity: How bad is the problem when it occurs?
By combining these factors, teams can assign appropriate priority levels to issues.
### 5. Prioritization Matrix
A Severity vs. Workarounds matrix helps categorize high-risk and low-risk issues:
| Severity | Workaround Available? | Priority Level |
| :--------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| High	| No	| Critical – Fix immediately | 
| High | Yes | High – Plan for next sprint |
| Low	| No	| Medium – Address soon | 
| Low	| Yes | Low – Revisit later | 


Prioritizing isn’t about doing everything, it’s about doing the right things first. Keep the balance:
 - Don’t let urgent things push out important ones forever.
 - Keep an eye on impact some things are just louder, not more critical.
