While cleaning up my old Dropbox folders I recently stumbled upon something that brought back a wave of nostalgia. A small Unity game I developed over a couple of weekends. A casual robot game inspired by the classic Crusader: No Regret, where the goal was straightforward - **take down enemy robots and stay alive**

This project took root during an 'exciting' time in game development. Back when Microsoft was actively encouraging developers to create apps and games for their Windows Phone ecosystem and were offering various incentives. As a single tinkerer eager to 'invest' my weekends, I decided to dive in and create something simple yet engaging.

#### Concept

I wanted the gameplay to be like Crusader: No Regret, a title I spent countless hours playing. But ended up with something that can best be described as a minimalist and casual indy game. No offence to indy game developers!! Armed with Unity and a weekend’s worth of free time, I focused on building core mechanics:

- A functional player character capable of movement and shooting.
- Enemy robots with basic behavior patterns.
- A compact level design that kept the action flowing and headache to a minimum.


#### Lost & Found

Finding this project after so many years was like unearthing a hidden treasure. It reminded me of the passion and creativity that sparked the idea and the excitement of learning new tools.
