The initial idea came to me while I was covering for a team mate back in Dec ’14. I started to work on it in Jan ’15 and since then it has grown from a vanilla HTML\JS application to more advanced HTML5+Jquery+Ajax+MongoDB app. 
Below is a write up on the application and some screen shots.

#### Use Case:
Develop a system which facilitates communication for resource assignments between Test leads and offshore contractors. Generate work performance information and reports for functional and group managers to drive data driven decisions. This system would need to replace the ease of using spreadsheets and generating quarterly\monthly reports.

#### Requirements\Stories:
- As a test lead I need to be able to quickly assign resources to the project with a focus on regression, package and fix testing.
- As a manager I need to be able to view resource utilization per month\quarter. And be able to analyze work performance per project.

#### Benefit:
Reduces the need to manually enter and keep track of data in a spread sheet. Once the data is entered, a email is sent to offshore testers and data is stored in a database. Reports can then be generated to slice and dice the data as needed.
