Strategy vs Tactics – Case study - Part 1
##### ref: https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/strategy-vs-tactics-difference-how-to-measure/

A strategy describes the long-term vision of what a product or service will look like and how it will serve customers’ needs.

Tactics are short-term actions that are designed and prioritized to help the product development team achieve the product strategy.


I would define QA strategy as a vision, a roadmap or mid- long-term goals and how to get there (initiatives, milestones, juggling alternatives).

QA tactics are related to execution. Focus is around “running” things. You need to be fact-driven, have a continuous feedback loop.

While managing a QA team, I got an opportunity to work towards setting up and executing on strategic goals.

My leadership had the following asks:

- Improve the quality of our product.

- Make improvements to our release process. AKA. release features faster.

- Work better as a team. -Something my immediate manager added!

To me these are great goals, but without knowing the people, technology and everything in between you can’t really come up with a strategy.

So I spent a few months working with my engineering team to understand who they were, how they worked and what they needed. 

From this effort, I was able to identify the following challenges:

- Great SMEs who worked in silo’s.

- Everybody had their own way of working. Creating tests, tracking effort and communication.

- Some aspects of engineering effort lacked identity and ownership.

- Disconnect between product testing and how customers used our products.


Based on this I defined our strategy as:

To be a team that provides QA service that delivers fast, simple and reliable customer focused validation of our product.

I categorized my tactics in three broad ways:

### Process:

- Create an identity for the team.

- Provide a standardized process across the team to track, manage and communicate work

### Ownership:

- Treat QA as a Product\Service.

- Champion automation as a mainstay and add metrics to track.

### Customer Empathy:

- Review past customer issues understand pain points.

- Rethink test environments to align with customer deployments.
